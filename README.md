# RoboFriends

![RoboFriends](https://github.com/wptechprdigy/robo-friends/blob/src/img/robofiends.png)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

RoboFriends uses an Online REST API, [JSON Placeholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/), a Fake Online Rest API for Testing and Prototyping Serving ~200M requests per month Powered by JSON Server + LowDB

I display my practical knowledge of React JS and its foundation: Javascript.

This also helps to show my ability to work with REST API.

The robots used in this project were gotten for [RoboHash](https://robohash.org), a easy web service that makes it easy to provide unique, robot/alien/monster/whatever images for any text.

I had fun building this and I hope you find it interesting.

Do you think I should include something? Let me know.

I am always open to feedback, that's the way we grow. So, help me grow.
